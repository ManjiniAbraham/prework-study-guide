# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was made for Bootcamp students as part of their assignment to take notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript and document them for further reference.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?
